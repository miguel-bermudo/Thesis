\chapterAbstract{H}{ere lies the acknowledgements of this work.}

% \chapterAbstract{E}{ven though this is the first section of this dissertation, it was the last one to be written. Perhaps because it may be the most important one. I would like to begin by thanking my advisors, David and Inma, for having given me the opportunity to join their group many years ago, and for their insightful guidance and advice throughout all this process. More importantly, I want to thank them for leading by their example of academical and personal honesty and integrity, and for the genuine care with which they treat everyone under their supervision. In particular, I want to thank David for the trust he has placed in me and my capabilities in a multitude of occasions; and Inma, for her constant availability and support, even when she barely had the time for it (and for her many excellent restaurant recommendations!). I feel very lucky for having had the opportunity and the pleasure to work with both of them.\\

% I would also like to thank my colleagues, teammates, and friends from Geozoco: Miguel and Fernando (and more recently, also Paula and Pepe) for the many good times and adventures that we have had together. They were the ones that made going to work not feel like going to work at all. Although we part ways for now, I leave with the certainty that those who are already pursuing their PhD, and those who should choose to do so in the future, are in very good hands. Regardless of the path they choose, I am convinced they will succeed in it.\\

% Furthermore, I want to extend my thanks to Dr. Francesco Osborne for facilitating the research stays that were carried out throughout the course of my PhD, as well as to the rest of his colleagues: Dr. Danilo Dess{\`i}, Dr. Diego Reforgiato Recupero, and Dr. Davide Buscaldi, for consistently finding the time to keep furthering our collaboration even to this day, for sharing their expertise in scientific Knowledge Graphs and many other fields with us, and for all the work that we have done together.\\

% I want to also acknowledge and thank the public education and scholarships system that, even with its many flaws and imperfections, has allowed me, and many others like me, to receive a high-quality education virtually free of charge, and to achieve my highest potential when I perhaps could not have afforded it. Likewise, I would like to thank the many teachers that I have had throughout the years, both in and out of university, without whom I could not have reached this point. During my PhD scholarship, I have had the privilege of teaching in the same university halls where I was a student not too long before. I firmly believe that the best teachers are those who know there is always something new they can learn, and thus I would also like to thank the students that I have had during these years, from whom I have learned a lot. I can only hope that I was the teacher they deserved.\\

% These final lines are dedicated to the most important people in my life, those who make me feel at home no matter where I am. To my grandparents Loli and Manolo, who did everything they could, and sometimes even more, to make sure we always had whatever we needed. To my parents Javier and Matilde, and my brother Caleb, for their absolute, unconditional, and unwavering love, support and understanding. And to my partner Ren, for an infinity of reasons that could not, and need not, be listed on these pages.
